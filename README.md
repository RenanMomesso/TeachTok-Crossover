# React Native Project Initialization

Welcome to a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, initialized using the [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you've completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler included with React Native. To start it, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# Or using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Launch your Application

Keep the Metro Bundler running in its terminal. In a new terminal and from your project's root, execute the following command to run your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# Or using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# Or using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If set up correctly, your app should appear in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, provided your emulator/simulator settings are accurate. Alternatively, you can also launch your app directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

### Step 3: Modify your App

Now that your app is up and running:

1. Open `App.tsx` in your preferred text editor and make some edits.
2. To see changes:
    - **For Android**: Double press the R key or select **"Reload"** from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M on Windows/Linux or Cmd âŒ˜ + M on macOS).
    - **For iOS**: Press Cmd âŒ˜ + R in the iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully launched and edited your React Native app. ðŸ¥³
